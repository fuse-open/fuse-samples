## A simple navigation tab bar using PageIndicator

This example shows how to create a navigation tab bar using the `PageIndicator`. This control instantiates a template for each page in the navigation. The `{Page ...}` binding can be used to link to resources on the pages.

This example uses the `ActivationAnimation` and `WhileActive` navigation triggers. All the standard triggers are available. The tabs behave essentially as though part of the page themselves.
