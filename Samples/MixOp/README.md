# Differences in `MixOp` with `Change`

This demo shows how the `MixOp` property of a `Change` animator can be used to alter how values affect the target.

The first test is using a single animator and the second one is using two animators on the same property. The tests use a non-zero rest state to help show the difference (as animating from 0 often ends up the same in the different modes).
